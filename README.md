Assignment Details:

Your task is to create a Flutter application that utilizes the GitHub API to retrieve and display information about GitHub repositories.
The application should have the following features:


1. First Page : https://api.github.com/users/{userName}
  - Here the user will input a username and after that you go to the home page.
  - Make sure the user can toggle between light and dark themes. 
2. Home Page : https://api.github.com/users/{userName}/repos 
 - In home page show user all the necessary information. 
 - Show the user repository list in a list view and grid view, and give the option to switch between gridview and listview. 
- Implement a filter option where the user can filter the repository list by date, name, start etc. 
3. Repository Details:
 - When a user taps on a repository, display detailed information about the repository.

 

Guidelines:
- Utilize the GitHub REST API for data retrieval (https://docs.github.com/en/rest).
- Use the latest flutter version.
- Use dio for api calling.
- Use Getx for state management.
- Make sure to commit your progress in git from initial setup.
- Ensure the application has a clean and intuitive user interface.
- Follow best practices for code organisation, readability, and maintainability.
- Implement error handling and provide appropriate feedback to the user.
- Use any additional libraries or packages you deem necessary.
- Submit your code as a GitHub repository and share the repository link with us at email.
- Submit your developed APK file with us at reply email.
